## Subject

### Mandatory part - miniRT

- Program name `miniRT`
- Turn in files: All your files
- Makefile `all`, `clean`, `fclean`, `re`, `bonus`
- Arguments: a scene in format `*.rt`
- External functs.
	- open, close, read, write, printf, malloc, free, perror, strerror, exit.
	- All functions of the math library. (Man page: man math.h or man 3 math. Donâ€™t forget to compile with the `-lm` flag).
	- All functions of the MinilibX library.
	- gettimeofday()
- Libft authorized Yes
- Description The goal of your program is to generate images using the Raytracing protocol. Those computer-generated images will each represent a scene, as seen from a specific angle and position, defined by simple geometric objects, and each with its own lighting system.

#### The constraints are as follows:

- You must use the miniLibX library, either the version that is available on the operating system, or from its sources. If you choose to work with the sources, you will need to apply the same rules for your libft as those written above in Common Instructions part.
- The management of your window must remain fluid: switching to another window, minimization, etc.
- You need at least these three simple geometric objects: plane, sphere, cylinder.
- If applicable, all possible intersections and the insides of the objects must be handled correctly.
- Your program must be able to resize the unique properties of objects: diameter for a sphere and the width and height for a cylinder.
- Your program must be able to apply translation and rotation transformations to objects, lights, and cameras (except for spheres and lights that cannot be rotated).
- Light management: spot brightness, hard shadows, ambient lighting (objects are never completely in the dark). You must implement ambient and diffuse lighting.
- The program displays the image in a window and respects the following rules:
	- Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program cleanly.
	- Clicking on the red cross on the window frame must close the window and quit the program cleanly.
	- The use of images from the minilibX library is strongly recommended.
- Your program must take as its first argument a scene description file with the `.rt` extension.
	- Each type of element can be separated by one or more line breaks.
	- Each type of information from an element can be separated by one or more spaces.
	- Each type of element can be set in any order in the file.
	- Elements defined by a capital letter can only be declared once in the scene.
	- The first piece of information for each element is the type identifier (composed of one or two characters), followed by all specific information for each object in a strict order such as:
		- Ambient lighting: `A 0.2 255,255,255`
			- identifier: A
			- ambient lighting ratio in the range [0.0,1.0]: 0.2
			- R, G, B colors in the range [0-255]: 255, 255, 255
		- Camera: `C -50.0,0,20 0,0,1 70`
			- identifier: C
			- x, y, z coordinates of the viewpoint: -50.0,0,20
			- 3D normalized orientation vector, in the range [-1,1] for each x, y, z axis: 0.0,0.0,1.0
			- FOV: Horizontal field of view in degrees in the range [0,180]: 70
		- Light: `L -40.0,50.0,0.0 0.6 10,0,255`
			- identifier: L
			- x, y, z coordinates of the light point: -40.0,50.0,0.0
			- the light brightness ratio in the range [0.0,1.0]: 0.6
			- (unused in mandatory part) R, G, B colors in the range [0-255]: 10, 0, 255
		- Sphere: `sp 0.0,0.0,20.6 12.6 10,0,255`
			- identifier: sp
			- x, y, z coordinates of the sphere center: 0.0,0.0,20.6
			- the sphere diameter: 12.6
			- R,G,B colors in the range [0-255]: 10, 0, 255
		- Plane: `pl 0.0,0.0,-10.0 0.0,1.0,0.0 0,0,225`
			- identifier: pl
			- x, y, z coordinates of a point in the plane: 0.0,0.0,-10.0
			- 3D normalized normal vector, in the range [-1,1] for each x, y, z axis: 0.0,1.0,0.0
			- R,G,B colors in the range [0-255]: 0,0,225
		- Cylinder: `cy 50.0,0.0,20.6 0.0,0.0,1.0 14.2 21.42 10,0,255`
			- identifier: cy
			- x, y, z coordinates of the center of the cylinder: 50.0,0.0,20.6
			- 3D normalized vector of axis of cylinder, in the range [-1,1] for each x, y, z axis: 0.0,0.0,1.0
			- the cylinder diameter: 14.2
			- the cylinder height: 21.42
			- R, G, B colors in the range [0,255]: 10, 0, 255

- Example of the mandatory part with a minimalist `.rt` scene:

```text
A 0.2 255,255,255
C -50,0,20 0,0,1 70
L -40,0,30 0.7 255,255,255
pl 0,0,0 0,1.0,0 255,0,225
sp 0,0,20 20 255,0,0
cy 50.0,0.0,20.6 0,0,1.0 14.2 21.42 10,0,255
```

- If any misconfiguration of any kind is encountered in the file, the program must exit properly and return "Error\n" followed by an explicit error message of your choice.
- For the defense, it would be ideal for you to have a whole set of scenes focused on what is functional, to facilitate the control of the elements to create.

### Bonus part

The Ray-Tracing technique could handle many more things like reflection, transparency, refraction, more complex objects, soft shadows, caustics, global illumination, bump mapping, .obj file rendering, etc.
But for the miniRT project, we want to keep things simple for your first ray tracer and your first steps in CGI.
Here is a list of a few simple bonuses you could implement. If you want to do bigger bonuses, we strongly advise you to recode a new ray tracer later in your developer life after this little one is finished and fully functional.

#### Bonus list:

- Add specular reflection to achieve a full Phong reflection model.
- Color disruption: checkerboard pattern.
- Colored and multi-spot lights.
- One other second-degree object: cone, hyperboloid, paraboloid..
- Handle bump map textures.

You are allowed to use other functions and add features to your scene description to complete the bonus part, as long as their use is justified during your evaluation. You are also allowed to modify the expected scene file format to fit your needs. Be smart!
